## Introduction


F3 aims to reinvent the traditional way of exploring new places. The app allows you to browse tours, the results can be filtered to a genre of your interest. The tours are an interactive way to experience the history and culture of a city.

The current tour presents users with a murder mystery styled treasure hunt, with clues and directions provided to help them discover historical landmarks across London's Westend while they hunt down the ellusive 'Charing Cross Charmer'.

With an easy-to-use UI and fluid sign-up process, F3 is a great way to get out and explore!
